## Using different machine learning algorithms to predict the type of exercise being done

The R script presented here (and its results PDF document) use several different machine learning algorithms to predict the type of exercise being done based on data from an accelerometer and gyrometer. The data is taken from a study that can be found here [http://web.archive.org/web/20161224072740/http:/groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har](http://web.archive.org/web/20161224072740/http:/groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har)
